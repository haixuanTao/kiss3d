//! A progressive GPU path tracer for photorealistic rendering.
//!
//! The path tracer renders the existing scene graph (meshes, PBR materials,
//! lights, camera) by Monte-Carlo path tracing on the GPU, accumulating samples
//! across frames for a noise-free, physically-based image. It is driven through
//! [`Window::raytrace_3d`](crate::window::Window::raytrace_3d).
//!
//! Two backends share the same shading kernel:
//! - **Compute** (always available): traverses a CPU-built BVH in a compute
//!   shader. Runs on every wgpu backend, including Metal and the web.
//! - **Hardware ray-query** (capable Vulkan GPUs): uses wgpu's experimental ray
//!   queries against hardware acceleration structures. Selected automatically
//!   when the GPU supports it, otherwise the compute backend is used.
//!
//! Accumulation restarts automatically when the camera moves, the viewport is
//! resized, or the scene changes. For in-place vertex edits that the change hash
//! does not capture, call [`RayTracer::mark_dirty`].
